Our expedition has reached the upper tributaries of the Rio Negro. The indigenous guides have spoken of ancient settlements deeper in the jungle. Of particular interest are their descriptions of a "city of stone" approximately two days' journey to the east of our current position. They claim it contains structures arranged in perfectly straight lines, with circular plazas at regular intervals. The local Kuikuro people refer to it as "the place of the ancestors." We plan to investigate tomorrow if weather permits.

Remarkable discovery today! After cutting through dense vegetation for hours, we came upon a series of low earthworks arranged in a precise geometric pattern, forming a rectangle approximately 200 meters on each side. Within this boundary, we found fragments of pottery unlike any I've seen in this region. The central area features a raised platform approximately 3 meters in height, with what appears to be a ceremonial path leading east toward the river. The entire site shows signs of sophisticated planning, with drainage channels and terraced sections.

Coordinates marked on map as approximately 3°5'S, 64°10'W.

Our excavations at the Pedra Pintada cave near Monte Alegre have yielded surprising evidence of early human occupation. More interesting, however, are the accounts from local residents about geometric earthworks visible only during the dry season, approximately 30 kilometers south-southeast of our current location (near coordinates 3°10'S, 64°0'W).

Aerial survey confirmed the presence of a complex of anthropogenic features. The site comprises a series of connected geometric shapes - predominantly circles and rectangles - covering an area of roughly 1 square kilometer. The larger circular structure has a diameter of approximately 100 meters, with smaller rectangular structures arranged in a spoke-like pattern around it. From above, the pattern is unmistakably intentional, suggesting a level of social organization far more sophisticated than previously documented in this region.

The local hydrology has been altered, with evidence of ancient canals connecting the site to the nearest river. Carbon dating of surface ceramics suggests occupation between 800-1200 CE, though deeper excavation may reveal earlier dates.

The satellite imagery has revealed several anomalous features in the vegetation patterns near the confluence of the Rio Negro and Rio Branco. These rectangular clearings, visible primarily through subtle differences in vegetation health, appear to be arranged in a grid-like pattern.

Ground verification has confirmed anthropogenic origin. We've found a complex of earthworks roughly 3 km south of marker point AZ-45 (approximately 2°58'S, 63°58'W). The main feature is a trapezoidal platform measuring approximately 80 meters at its widest point, with clear evidence of post holes suggesting substantial wooden structures once stood here. Ceramic fragments show sophisticated manufacturing techniques and standardized decorative patterns. 

Most significant is the discovery of a series of linear ridges extending outward from the central platform in the cardinal directions. The northern ridge connects to a perfectly circular depression approximately 50 meters in diameter, consistent with a ceremonial plaza. The absence of stone architecture may have led previous explorers to overlook these sites, but the earthworks themselves represent a significant engineering achievement, particularly in terms of flood control and agricultural management.

INDIGENOUS ORAL HISTORY RECORDED BY ETHNOGRAPHER EDUARDO NEVES, 2013

Narrative from Elder Kamarakoto (Yanomami), age 78:
"The ancestors built many villages before the great sickness came. The largest village was where the black water meets the tree with three trunks [identified as a distinctive landmark at approximately 3°2'S, 64°5'W]. It had walls of earth taller than a man, arranged in a circle with four entrances. Inside were houses for many families, and in the center was the sacred place where the wise ones kept the knowledge. Beyond the walls were gardens that fed everyone, with channels to bring water during the dry season. The village had straight paths that led to other villages, connecting them like a spider's web. When the strangers brought sickness, the people fled, and the forest covered everything. But the paths of the ancestors are still there, under the trees."

Narrative from Tuiuca guide, recorded near coordinate 3°0'S, 64°0'W:
"This place has powerful spirits. Our grandparents' grandparents knew not to build here or cut these trees. The ground has many treasures buried by the ancient ones. During the driest months, you can see the shapes they made in the earth—perfect circles and straight lines that no ordinary person could create. The elders say this was a place of meeting for many different peoples who came to trade and celebrate when the river was lower. They built their houses on raised earth to stay dry when the waters came."
