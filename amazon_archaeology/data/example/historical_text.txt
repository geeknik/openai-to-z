Expedition Journal: Lower Amazon Basin Exploration
By Dr. James Thornton
March-June, 1923

Our expedition has finally reached the tributary of the Negro River, approximately 120 miles west of Manaus. The indigenous guides from the Tukano people speak of ancient settlements hidden beneath the canopy. They refer to a place called "The City of Stone Houses" that lies roughly three days' journey north of our current position, near the hills that rise about 300 feet above the floodplain.

Today we've discovered curious geometric patterns in the vegetation about 15 miles upstream from our base camp. From the elevated position on the hillside, one can observe perfect rectangles and connected lines that are certainly not natural formations. The local guide Fernando believes these to be the remains of ancient defensive structures, perhaps dating back several centuries. The rectangular formation measures approximately 800 feet by 600 feet, with what appears to be a central plaza.

We have reached coordinates approximately 2°30'S, 63°45'W, where we've observed remarkable soil discolorations in a circular pattern spanning roughly 1000 feet in diameter. The soil is noticeably darker than surrounding areas—what locals call "terra preta" (black earth). This anthropogenic soil is a well-known indicator of long-term human settlement. Ceramic fragments scattered throughout the area corroborate this hypothesis.

After following the winding tributary for another 30 miles eastward, we've come upon an extraordinary discovery—a series of perfectly straight lines cut through the jungle, visible only from the ridge we climbed this morning. These lines extend for several miles and intersect at right angles, forming what can only be described as a planned network. One of the indigenous guides mentioned that his ancestors spoke of great roads that connected villages throughout the region.

Near the confluence where the smaller river joins the main channel (approx. 3°15'S, 64°10'W), we've documented a series of large mounds arranged in a precise geometric pattern. There are 12 mounds in total, each rising between 15-20 feet above the forest floor. They form what appears to be a celestial alignment, with the largest mound at the center. Local legends speak of these as burial sites for great chiefs, though without excavation we cannot confirm this.

Today's findings near 3°0'S, 63°30'W have been most promising. We've documented extensive earthworks visible as subtle elevation changes forming perfect circles and connecting causeways. The main circular structure has a diameter of approximately 300 yards with what appears to be carefully designed entrances aligned to the cardinal directions. The indigenous guides refuse to enter this area, claiming it is a sacred place where the "ancient ones" conducted ceremonies.

May 20, 1923
Our expedition has reached the unusual rock formations mentioned in Professor Ramirez's earlier reports. At coordinates 2°45'S, 63°15'W, we've found large stone blocks arranged in what can only be described as purposeful configurations. Some appear to form walls or foundations, though much is hidden beneath centuries of soil and vegetation. Most intriguing are the carved symbols on several of the stones—geometric patterns and representations of what may be astronomical phenomena.

As our expedition nears its conclusion, we've made perhaps our most significant discovery yet. Approximately at 2°50'S, 64°5'W, we've documented an extensive settlement complex spanning several square miles. The site features large earthen platforms, water management systems including canals and reservoirs, and distinct zones that suggest specialized activities. I am convinced this represents the remains of a sophisticated pre-Columbian urban center that may have supported thousands of inhabitants.

These findings challenge the long-held belief that the Amazon rainforest was sparsely populated prior to European contact. The scale and sophistication of these discoveries suggest complex societies thrived here, utilizing advanced agricultural and architectural techniques adapted to the challenging rainforest environment. Upon our return, I shall propose a more comprehensive expedition to fully document what may be one of the most significant archaeological regions in South America.
