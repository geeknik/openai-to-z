DESIGN.md: OpenAI to Z Challenge Discovery Tool

1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive design for a digital exploration and archaeological discovery tool leveraging the latest OpenAI models, including o3/o4 mini and GPT-4.1, to discover unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon biome. This approach integrates multiple open-source datasets, high-resolution satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, historical records, Indigenous narratives, and AI-driven methodologies.

2. Objectives
	•	Identify unknown archaeological sites within the Amazon biome.
	•	Integrate diverse datasets (satellite, LiDAR, historical documents, oral narratives).
	•	Implement reproducible, AI-enhanced discovery methods.
	•	Ensure robustness, scalability, and ease of use for non-technical archaeologists.

3. Data Sources and Integration

3.1 Primary Datasets
	•	Satellite Imagery:
	•	Sentinel-1/2, Landsat via Google Earth Engine (GEE)
	•	European Space Agency open-source data
	•	NASA catalog (25,000+ datasets)
	•	NICFI & SRTM for vegetation and terrain analysis
	•	Sentinel-2 optical imagery for vegetation scars detection (10m resolution)
	•	LiDAR and Elevation:
	•	OpenTopography LiDAR (1-10m resolution)
	•	AWS CLI datasets covering Amazonian regions
	•	GEDI canopy data for subtle vegetation dips indicating ancient structures
	•	Historical and Archaeological:
	•	Expedition logs from Library of Congress
	•	Indigenous oral maps from digitized archives
	•	Archaeological point datasets from Archeo Blog
	•	Relevant academic literature for cross-validation ￼

4. Methodology

4.1 AI-Driven Remote Sensing Pipeline

Establish an AI pipeline to systematically analyze integrated data:
	•	Initial feature detection (LiDAR geometries, vegetation anomalies via Sentinel imagery)
	•	Historical data correlation (textual analysis of expedition logs and oral histories)
	•	Validation pipeline using multiple independent data sources to verify discovered sites.

4.2 Feature Detection Models
	•	Custom-trained classifiers using o3/o4 mini and GPT-4.1:
	•	LiDAR Raster Scanner:

Scan LiDAR raster for geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, ditches) ≥80m. Provide approximate center coordinates.


	•	Historical Text Analyzer:

Extract and geocode references to rivers, directions, and distances from expedition diaries.


	•	Sentinel-2 Surface Classifier:

Given coordinates, analyze Sentinel-2 scenes for anthropogenic vs. natural soil patterns. Provide 0–1 confidence.



4.3 Novel Predictive Model: Historical-Anthropogenic Landscape Detector (HALD)

A deep learning model trained on known sites to predict previously undiscovered archaeological features by recognizing landscape alterations indicative of ancient human settlements.

5. Technical Architecture

5.1 System Components
	•	Backend: Python (FastAPI), integration with Google Earth Engine API, OpenTopography API, AWS data pipelines.
	•	AI/ML Models: OpenAI APIs (o3/o4 mini, GPT-4.1), Hugging Face transformer models for NLP tasks.
	•	Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data management.
	•	Visualization: Interactive frontend built with React and Mapbox GL JS for visualization of spatial data and potential sites.

5.2 Workflow Automation
	•	Automated scripts to fetch, preprocess, and analyze satellite imagery and LiDAR data.
	•	NLP pipeline integrated with OpenAI models for analyzing and geocoding textual historical data.
	•	Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions.

6. Discovery Validation Protocol

6.1 Two-Source Rule
	•	Confirm each discovery with two independent methodologies:
	•	Satellite/LiDAR feature confirmation.
	•	Correlation with historical expedition diaries and Indigenous oral maps.

6.2 Output Structure

Structured and reproducible results:
	•	Precise longitude/latitude coordinates.
	•	Confidence levels for each method of confirmation.
	•	Detailed visual evidence (spatial overlays, LiDAR scans).

7. Innovation and Originality

7.1 Anthropogenic Signature Analysis

Develop a novel AI model capable of distinguishing subtle anthropogenic terrain alterations from natural features at scale.

7.2 Indigenous Narrative Integration

Systematic integration of Indigenous oral narratives via NLP for identifying potential sites, enhancing historical context, and prioritizing respectful engagement with Indigenous communities.

8. Documentation and Reproducibility

8.1 Comprehensive Logging
	•	Log files recording dates, prompt iterations, dataset IDs, and hyperparameter settings.
	•	Detailed documentation of methodological steps, ensuring ease of reproduction.

8.2 Interactive Dashboard

A web-based dashboard with:
	•	Interactive map interface.
	•	Detailed logs and prompt history.
	•	Exportable results package for submissions and validation.

9. Community and Ethical Considerations
	•	Active engagement with the archaeological community and local Indigenous populations for ethical data use and responsible exploration.
	•	Transparency in methodology, encouraging community collaboration and feedback via an open GitHub repository and public communication channels.

10. Submission Deliverables
	•	GitHub repository containing:
	•	Full source code.
	•	Scripts for data fetching and processing.
	•	AI models and custom prompts.
	•	Document package:
	•	Detailed write-up explaining insights and discoveries.
	•	Maps, visualizations, and screenshots supporting claims.
	•	200-word abstract summarizing the significance of findings and method innovation.

11. Timeline and Milestones
	•	Week 1-2: Data aggregation, initial prompt engineering, preliminary site identification tests.
	•	Week 3-4: Implementation of HALD model, refinement based on initial discoveries.
	•	Week 5: Validation of identified sites, integration of historical textual data.
	•	Week 6: Comprehensive documentation, preparation of interactive dashboard.
	•	Final Week: Submission finalization and community engagement.

12. Final Thoughts

This design leverages powerful AI capabilities combined with diverse, openly available data sources to create an innovative, reproducible, and impactful archaeological discovery tool. Our aim is to significantly advance the understanding of Amazonian history, support ethical archaeological practices, and set a new standard in AI-driven archaeological exploration.

Let’s dig deep, push boundaries, and rewrite Amazonian history.
